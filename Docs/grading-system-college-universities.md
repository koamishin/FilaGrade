# Grading Systems in Philippine Colleges and Universities: An Expert Analysis

Grading systems serve as the cornerstone of academic evaluation within higher education institutions worldwide, providing a structured framework for assessing student performance and communicating academic standing. In the Philippines, the landscape of these systems in colleges and universities presents a diverse array of practices, reflecting the autonomous nature of these institutions and their varied historical and pedagogical approaches. Understanding the intricacies of these grading systems is paramount for students navigating their academic journeys, parents seeking insights into their children's progress, educators aiming to provide effective guidance, and external stakeholders evaluating the qualifications of graduates. This report offers a comprehensive analysis of the grading systems prevalent in Philippine colleges and universities, exploring the common scales, the meaning of different grades, variations across institutions and programs, the calculation of academic averages, passing requirements, and recent developments in this area.

## Common Grading Scales

Philippine higher education institutions primarily employ two main grade point scales to evaluate student performance: the 5-point scale, ranging from 1.00 to 5.00, and the 4-point scale, ranging from 4.00 to 1.00 [1].

*   **5-Point Scale:** This scale typically designates 1.00 as the highest possible grade, indicating exceptional academic achievement [1]. The lowest mark considered passing within this system is commonly 3.00 [1]. Conversely, a grade of 5.00 signifies failure to meet the course requirements [1]. Notably, a grade of 4.00 is often used to denote an incomplete status ("INC"), signifying that the student has yet to fulfill certain course requirements [1]. Numerous prominent universities across the Philippines utilize the 5-point scale, including the University of the Philippines, Polytechnic University of the Philippines, Central Colleges of the Philippines, STI College, University of Santo Tomas, San Beda University, Tarlac State University, Mapúa University, University of the East, and University of San Carlos [2].

*   **4-Point Scale:** In contrast, the 4-point scale mirrors the grading system commonly found in the United States, where 4.00 represents the pinnacle of academic success [1]. Within this framework, a grade of 0.00 typically indicates a failing performance [1]. The minimum grade required to pass a course under this system generally falls around 2.00, although some institutions might set it at 1.00 depending on their specific academic policies [4]. Several esteemed Philippine universities have adopted the 4-point scale, including Far Eastern University, National University-Manila, Silliman University, Adventist University of the Philippines, De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde, De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute, De La Salle University, and De La Salle University-Dasmariñas [2].

Beyond these primary scales, some institutions, such as Ateneo de Manila University and its affiliated schools, may primarily employ a letter grade system, with associated percentage and grade point equivalents that align with either a 4-point structure or a similar conceptual framework [2]. Furthermore, a percentage-based grading system, ranging from 0 to 100%, is also utilized, often in conjunction with the point scales or for the assessment of individual coursework [2].

It is crucial to recognize that a standardized grade equivalence does not exist across all Philippine universities, meaning the numerical ranges or grade point values corresponding to specific letter grades can vary considerably from one institution to another [2].

## Meaning of Grades and Equivalences

The meaning of letter grades and their corresponding numerical or grade point values exhibit significant variations across Philippine colleges and universities, underscoring the absence of a unified national standard [2].

*   **Examples (5-Point Scale):**
    *   *University of the Philippines:* A+ (99-100%) = 1.0; A (96-98%) = 1.25 [2].
    *   *Polytechnic University of the Philippines:* 1.00 (Excellent) = 97-100% [2].
    *   *Central Colleges of the Philippines:* 1.00 (Excellent) = 96-100% [2].
    *   *STI College:* 3.0 (Passing) = 69.50-73.49% [2].
    *   *University of Santo Tomas:* Uses distinct percentage ranges for 1.00-3.00 [2].
    *   *San Beda University:* 1.00 (Excellent) = 98-100% [2].
    *   *Tarlac State University (Eng. & Tech.):* 2.75 (Passing) = 65-69%; 3.00 = 60-64% [2].
    *   *University of the East:* C- (3.00, Passing) = 75-76% [2].
    *   *University of San Carlos:* Utilizes a granular numerical scale with specific ranges [2].

*   **Examples (4-Point Scale):**
    *   *Far Eastern University:* A (4.00) = 92-100%; D (1.00, Passing) = 50-56% [2].
    *   *De La Salle University:* 1.00 (Passing) = 60-65% OR 70-74% [2].
    *   *Ateneo de Manila University:* A (4.0) = 92-100%; C (2.0, Passing) = 75-78% [2].
    *   *International School Manila:* D- (0.7, Passing) = 60-62% [2].

These examples unequivocally illustrate the absence of a standardized system for grade equivalences in Philippine higher education [2]. The varied equivalence ranges and passing grade thresholds underscore the institution-specific nature of academic standards in the Philippines [2]. This lack of uniformity presents challenges for students transferring between institutions and for the international recognition of academic credentials.

## Variations Across Institutions and Programs

The grading systems employed by Philippine colleges and universities exhibit variations primarily at the institutional level [2]. Each institution exercises its autonomy in selecting either the 5-point scale, the 4-point scale, or a unique system tailored to its specific needs and academic philosophy. Even when institutions utilize the same scale, the specific numerical ranges associated with grade descriptors can differ substantially.

While the provided information does not explicitly detail variations within academic programs, it is conceivable that certain programs might have distinct grading policies due to professional accreditation requirements or the specialized nature of the discipline. For instance:

*   The Philippine Science High School System employs a unique grading scale that differs from the typical tertiary scales [12].
*   Mapúa University's grading system has different descriptions for Master's/Diploma and Doctoral programs [2].

The use of a 100-point scale in some institutions further contributes to this diverse landscape [7]. These variations can complicate the direct comparison of academic performance across different universities and may pose challenges for employers or graduate admissions committees evaluating candidates from diverse academic backgrounds within the Philippines. Students transferring between institutions must carefully understand the grading policies of their new university to accurately assess their academic standing.

## Calculation of Academic Averages (GWA/GPA)

In Philippine colleges and universities, the **General Weighted Average (GWA)** serves as the primary metric for evaluating a student's overall scholastic performance [2]. Similar to the Grade Point Average (GPA) used in other educational systems, GWA is often calculated as a weighted average that takes into account the credit units assigned to each course [2].

The typical method for calculating GWA involves:
1.  Multiplying the grade obtained in each course by its corresponding number of credit units [6].
2.  Summing these weighted grades for all courses taken within a specific academic period [13].
3.  Dividing the total sum of the weighted grades by the total number of credit units taken during that period [13].

The formula is commonly expressed as:
\[ GWA = \frac{\sum (\text{Grade in each course} \times \text{Credit Units of the course})}{\text{Total Number of Credit Units}} \] [15]

While the weighted average method is prevalent for GWA, some institutions, particularly those using a 4-point scale, might use the term **GPA** and calculate it similarly to the US system (assigning point values to letter grades and averaging, sometimes considering credit hours) [2]. Some sources mention a simpler average method (summing grades and dividing by the number of subjects, without weighting) [13], but this is likely less common for official GWA calculation at the university level.

Additionally, some universities might calculate a **Curriculum Weighted Average (CWA)**, which is similar to GWA but focuses only on subjects within a specific program curriculum [2]. The GWA is a critical indicator used for determining academic honors, graduation eligibility, and sometimes for graduate program admissions or employment opportunities [2].

## Passing Requirements

The definition of a passing grade in Philippine colleges and universities is contingent upon the specific grading scale employed by the institution.

*   **5-Point Scale Systems:** The most frequently cited lowest passing grade is 3.00, often corresponding to a percentage range of 75-77% [1]. However, variations exist (e.g., STI College: 3.00 ≈ 69.50-73.49%; Tarlac State Univ. Eng.: 2.75 = 65-69%) [2]. A grade of 4.00 is sometimes used as a "Conditional" grade, requiring additional student action [2].

*   **4-Point Scale Systems:** The passing grade exhibits greater variability. Some institutions may consider 1.00 (often 60-74%) as passing, while others might require 2.00 (often 75-84%) [2].

Beyond numerical grades, specific courses or academic levels may have additional requirements, such as completing all major assignments or passing a final examination [2]. Failure to complete requirements might result in an "Incomplete" grade, potentially becoming a failing grade if unresolved [2]. Some graduate programs might use a Pass/Fail system for certain coursework (e.g., thesis) [3].

Universities typically establish a minimum GWA requirement for maintaining good academic standing and qualifying for graduation [3], which can vary between institutions and programs. Students receiving failing grades often must retake the course or attend remedial classes to earn credit [6].

## Recent Developments and Trends

The available research does not point to recent, comprehensive national-level changes to the college grading system mandated by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). However, several trends and discussions are notable:

*   **Institutional Updates:** Individual universities update their grading policies periodically (e.g., Mapúa University in AY 2021) [2].
*   **Post-Pandemic Adjustments:** Discussions occurred regarding the impact of lifting the "no-fail" policy implemented during the pandemic, particularly concerning grade distributions at institutions like the University of the Philippines [22].
*   **Outcomes-Based Education (OBE):** CHED Memorandum Order No. 15, Series of 2019 (Graduate Programs), emphasizes alignment with OBE and the Philippine Qualifications Framework (PQF) [23]. This broader shift towards OBE could indirectly influence assessment and grading practices.
*   **Grade Inflation Concerns:** Observations of higher grade distributions post-pandemic have led to internal reviews and discussions about potential grade inflation at some institutions [22].
*   **Basic Education Context:** DepEd's stance against a "pass or drop" system for basic education [24] and the competency-based approach of the K-12 grading system (DepEd Order No. 8, s. 2015) [25] reflect a broader educational philosophy favouring detailed assessment, which might influence higher education.

## Conclusion

The grading system in Philippine colleges and universities is characterized by the prevalent use of either a 5-point or a 4-point scale, yet marked by substantial variation in implementation across institutions regarding grade equivalences, descriptors, and passing thresholds. The General Weighted Average (GWA) is the primary metric for overall academic standing, typically calculated using course credit units. Passing requirements are institution-specific.

While major national reforms are absent, individual institutional updates and the influence of broader educational trends like OBE suggest gradual evolution. Key takeaways include:

*   **Diversity:** Significant institutional autonomy leads to diverse grading practices.
*   **Lack of Standardization:** No single national standard exists for grade equivalence.
*   **Importance of GWA:** GWA is crucial for academic progression and opportunities.
*   **Need for Clarity:** Students must understand their specific institution's policies. Institutions should prioritize transparency.

Given the lack of standardization, institutions could enhance clarity by providing detailed explanations of their grading systems on academic transcripts. Further dialogue among higher education stakeholders and CHED could explore ways to improve the comparability and understanding of grading systems nationally and internationally. A thorough understanding of this multifaceted system is essential for all stakeholders involved in Philippine higher education.
